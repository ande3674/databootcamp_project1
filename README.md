Alexis's Contributions:
	Researched Covid and Census APIs and helped create the code to gather the COVID Data from the API
	Explored the Crude Mortality Rate and used the census package to gather the data necessary to perform that analysis
	Assisted other team members in writing code for the project including code to work with the data and some functions
	Helped with code clean up & organizing our functions into a python file 
	Performed some other small tasks to improve the overall project including creating inverse columns in the master dataframe

Rhyce's Contributions:
	With guidance, merged happiness and coronavirus datasets into our project's main dataset.
	Evaluated covid mortality as a function of community happiness and made scatter plot with regression line
	Drew conclusions on the project's finding from ANOVA test results
	Presented on statistical testing and conclusions and commented on dataset limitations


Jason's Contributions:
	I developed the following functions in a .py file for our data analysis and to import into our Jupyter notebook:
	regressionLine - to draw regression lines on the scatter plots
	scatterDraw - to draw scatter plots from various data
	stateGrouper - to bin a varibale field, variable dataframe and number of bins
	boxDraw - to draw the box plots of various data
	
	Wrote the API Call and dataframe for the COVID state data (CovidAPI.ipynb)
	epochConverter function - to convert Unix eopch date received in the COVID API data
